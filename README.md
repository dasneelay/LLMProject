# NeeLLM - WIP
NeeLLM is the latest version of my causal language model project. This is an LLM specialized in code completion for data science-related tasks with libraries like Pandas. It's trained from scratch using GPT-2's configurations. While it's still a work in progress, the latest version can be found [here on ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/dneelay/codeparrot-ds-accelerate).
